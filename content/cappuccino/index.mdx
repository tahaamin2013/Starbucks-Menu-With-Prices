## Cappuccino
  
For those who love strong coffee but find espresso too strong, Starbucks Cappuccino offers a smooth and mild taste. It is a good choice. Cappuccino is like espresso but has a different flavor.

A Cappuccino combines hot water with espresso. During World War II, U.S. soldiers in Europe added water to espresso to make it like the coffee they drank at home. This drink became known as "Americano."

A standard 8-ounce cup of Cappuccino contains only 5 calories, 75 mg of caffeine and has negligible amounts of fat, cholesterol, and sugars.
