## Cappuccino

For those who love strong coffee but find espresso too strong, Starbucks Café Americano offers a smooth and mild taste. It is a good choice. Café Americano is like espresso but has a different flavor.

A Café Americano combines hot water with espresso. During World War II, U.S. soldiers in Europe added water to espresso to make it like the coffee they drank at home. This drink became known as "Americano."

The standard recipe includes water and Signature Espresso Roast. The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and has a caramel flavour. The standard number of espresso shots depends on the size of the drink:

<div style={{width:"300px"}}>
| Size    |  Volume      | Standard Espresso Shots |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| Short   | 8 fl oz      | 1                       |
| Tall    | 12 fl oz     | 2                       |
| Grande  | 16 fl oz     | 3                       |
| Venti   | 20 fl oz     | 4                       |
</div>

You can customise your drink by choosing no water, light water, or extra water.

If you like a smooth, vibrant, and slightly citrusy taste, you can go for Blonde Espresso Roast.

If you don't like Signature or Blonde Espresso Roast, you can choose one of the following:

 - ⅓ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ½ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - ⅔ Decaf Espresso Roast
 - Decaf Espresso Roast

You can also customise the number of shots for any size, up to a maximum of 12 shots.

A standard 8-ounce cup of Café Americano contains only five calories and 75 mg of caffeine. The amounts of fat, cholesterol, and sugar are negligible.
