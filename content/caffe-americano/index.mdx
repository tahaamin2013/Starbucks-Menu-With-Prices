## Caffè Americano 
For those who love strong coffee but find espresso too strong, Starbucks Café Americano offers a rich, smooth and milder taste, making it an ideal choice.

Café Americano resembles a regular espresso coffee but with a slightly different flavor.

In World War II, American Soldiers in Europe used to dilute espresso with water to approximate the coffee they were used to back home. This less concentrated espresso is called “Americao”

A Café Americano is typically made by diluting espresso with hot water. 

A standard 8-ounce cup of Café Americano contains only 5 calories, 75 mg of caffeine and has negligible amounts of fat, cholesterol, and sugars.
