## Caffè Americano
For those who love strong coffee but find espresso too strong, Starbucks Café Americano offers a rich, smooth and milder taste, making it an ideal choice.

Café Americano resembles a regular espresso coffee but with a slightly different flavor.

During World War II, American soldiers in Europe diluted espresso with water to resemble the coffee they were accustomed to back home. This diluted espresso came to be known as "Americano."

A Café Americano is typically made by diluting espresso with hot water. 

A standard 8-ounce cup of Café Americano contains only 5 calories, 75 mg of caffeine and has negligible amounts of fat, cholesterol, and sugars.
