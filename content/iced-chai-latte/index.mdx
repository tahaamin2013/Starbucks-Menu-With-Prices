## Iced Chai Latte 
  
> If you avoid Coffee due to its bitter taste, Do not worry; try 'Iced Chai Latte.'

U.S. soldiers faced the same coffee issue during World War II. At that time, very strong Espresso Coffee was available in Europe, but the soldiers did not drink such strong Coffee at home. 

To make Espresso less strong, the soldiers had to add water. This process gave them Coffee that met their desired standards. The diluted Espresso Coffee later became famous as "Caffe Americano."

The Signature Espresso Roast is bold, smooth, and has a caramel flavour. The standard number of espresso shots depends on the size of the drink:

| Venti   | 20 fl oz     | 4                       |

You can customise your drink by choosing no water, light water, or extra water.

If you like a smooth, vibrant, and slightly citrusy taste, you can go for Blonde Espresso Roast.
